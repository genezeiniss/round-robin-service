# Round Robin HTTP Routing Service

## Overview

An implementation of an HTTP Round Robin load balancer that distributes requests evenly across multiple Echo Service instances (running independently on different ports).

Each request is forwarded to the next available Echo instance in rotation, and the response from the Echo Service is returned to the client.
