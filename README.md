# Round Robin HTTP Routing Service

## Overview

An implementation of an HTTP Round Robin load balancer that distributes requests evenly across multiple Echo Service instances (running independently on different ports).

Each request is forwarded to the next available Echo instance in rotation, and the response from the Echo Service is returned to the client.

---
## Features
- **Round Robin Request Distribution**: Evenly distributes HTTP POST requests across configured backend instances
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatically retries with next available instance if one fails
- **Thread-safe Implementation**: Uses Atomic objects for safe concurrent access
- **Easy Configuration**: Backend instances configured via properties file
- **Retry Mechanism**: Configurable retry logic for failed requests

---
## **Technologies**
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Maven** (dependency management)

---
## **Setup**
### Prerequisites
- Java 21 JDK
- Maven 3.8+

### Installation

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The list of Echo Service URLs must be configured via application properties or as a command-line argument.

echo-service.instances=http://localhost:3001/api/echo,http://localhost:3002/api/echo,http://localhost:3003/api/echo
```
